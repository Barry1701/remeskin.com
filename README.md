# Remeskin

## Project Description

Thanks to remeskin.com, users will be able to:

- Post images of their skin symptoms and ask for advice or product recommendations from others.
- Share personal experiences related to eczema, allergies, and treatment methods.
- Support each other with practical advice and success stories in managing symptoms.
- Build a community that reduces the feelings of isolation and helplessness that can accompany these conditions.

This platform provides a space for people to exchange information and feel less alone in their struggles. In the future, plans include adding resources from specialists, but initially, the primary focus is to empower those who face these challenges daily.
