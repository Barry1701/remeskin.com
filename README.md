## üöÄ Frontend Deployment

### Hosting Platform
- The frontend of the **Remeskin** platform is hosted on **Heroku**.

### Deployment Process
To deploy the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a production-ready build using:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - This command generates an optimized build in the `build/` folder.

2. **Create a Heroku App**:
   - Log in to Heroku using:
     ```bash
     heroku login
     ```
   - Create a new Heroku application:
     ```bash
     heroku create remeskin-frontend
     ```

3. **Configure Heroku for Static File Hosting**:
   - Add a `static.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "root": "build/"
     }
     ```
   - This tells Heroku to serve static files from the `build/` folder.

4. **Add Buildpacks**:
   - Configure Heroku buildpacks for React apps:
     ```bash
     heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app
     ```

5. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   - Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Add all files and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Deploy frontend to Heroku"
     ```
   - Push the code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```

6. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the environment variable for the backend API URL:
     ```bash
     heroku config:set REACT_APP_API_URL=<your-backend-api-url>
     ```

7. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Visit the live frontend application at the URL provided by Heroku.

### Environment Variables
- **REACT_APP_API_URL**: URL for the backend API (e.g., `https://drestf-api-8914bba56128.herokuapp.com/`).

### Continuous Deployment
- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for automatic deployment whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
