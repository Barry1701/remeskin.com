## üé® Design

This document outlines the key visual and UX design decisions for **Remeskin**, including color palette, typography, layout structure, and commonly used UI components.

---

### 1. Color Palette

In the CSS files, several repeated color patterns and gradients are used. Below is a consolidated palette:

- **Gradient (Navbar)**  
  - `#6dd5ed` ‚Üí `#2193b0` (linear gradient)
- **Gradient (Category Labels / ‚ÄúWow Effect‚Äù)**  
  - `#ff7e5f` ‚Üí `#feb47b`
- **Accent Colors**  
  - **Buttons & Background Variation**: `#242a3d` (dark blue-gray) or `#2142b2` (deep blue)  
  - **Hearts (Liked Posts)**: `#f85032`
- **Base Background** (in `index.css`)  
  - A repeated texture plus a light linear gradient (`#e6e9f0` ‚Üí `#eef1f5`)
- **Text**  
  - Default: `#333`  
  - Lighter text (e.g., dates): `#c1c1c5` or `#555555`

> **Tip:** If you want to standardize these colors further, consider defining them as CSS variables or SCSS variables.

---

### 2. Typography

- **Primary Font**: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) (imported in `index.html`).  
  - Fallback stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif`
- **Code Snippets**  
  - `source-code-pro, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace`
- **Font Sizes**  
  - Forms, buttons, and general text: typically `14px‚Äì16px`  
  - `.Header` class: `16px`, uppercase, letter-spacing  
  - Icons: `i { font-size: 1.6rem }`

Since Bootstrap 4.6 is included, I also inherit its default font sizing (e.g., `<h1>` through `<h6>`).

---

### 3. Icons

- **Font Awesome** is used via a `<script>` in `index.html`.
- Common icons:  
  - Sign-in/out (`fa-sign-in-alt`, `fa-sign-out-alt`), user (`fa-user`, `fa-user-plus`), heart (`fa-heart`), comments (`fa-comments`), etc.
- Additional usage:  
  - **3-dot menu**: `fa-ellipsis-v` (for `<MoreDropdown>`).

---

### 4. Layout & Responsiveness

#### 4.1 Overall Structure

- **Navbar** (fixed, gradient background)  
  - Uses `<Navbar>` from `react-bootstrap` and custom CSS in `NavBar.module.css`.
  - Collapses on mobile, toggled with a custom hook (`useClickOutsideToggle.js`).
- **Main Content**  
  - Wrapped in a `<Container>` with `.Main { padding-top: 81px }` to account for navbar height.
- **Background**  
  - A repeated dark texture plus a linear gradient, set in `body` (see `index.css`).

#### 4.2 CSS Modules & Media Queries

- Each component (e.g., `NavBar`, `Post`, `Comment`) often has its own `.module.css`.
- **Responsive breakpoints** leverage Bootstrap‚Äôs defaults (sm, md, lg, xl).
  - For instance, `.d-none d-lg-block` to hide/show elements depending on screen size.

#### 4.3 Common Layout Patterns

- **Two-column layout** on wider screens: main feed (`lg=8`) + sidebar (`lg=4`).
- On smaller viewports, the sidebar is hidden or moved below the main feed.

---

### 5. Core UI Components

1. **Navbar** (`NavBar.js`)
   - Gradient background, sign-in / sign-up links for guests, or user profile links if logged in.
   - `.NavLink` classes control text color, hover transitions, and icons.

2. **Buttons** (various styles in `Button.module.css`)
   - Classes like `.Blue`, `.BlueOutline`, `.Black`, `.BlackOutline`, `.Bright`.
   - Rounded corners (`border-radius: 100px`), hover states that invert colors, etc.

3. **Cards / Posts**
   - Implemented via `<Card>` from `react-bootstrap` + additional styles in `Post.module.css`.
   - Category labels (like ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúEczema‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllergy‚Äù) have bright gradient backgrounds with hover scaling.

4. **Forms** (Sign in/up, PostCreateForm, ProductCreateForm, etc.)
   - Typically use `<Form>` from `react-bootstrap` plus modular CSS (`SignInUpForm.module.css`, `PostCreateEditForm.module.css`).
   - Validation errors displayed with `<Alert>`.

5. **Alerts / Modals**
   - [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for success/error confirmations.
   - `<Alert>` from `react-bootstrap` for inline messages (e.g., form validation).

6. **Avatars**
   - `Avatar.js` uses `.Avatar` from `Avatar.module.css` to present user images in circular form.

---

### 6. Highlights & Visual Effects

- **Hover States**
  - Navbar: slightly darker gradient on hover.
  - Category chips: color gradient flips, scale effect (`transform: scale(1.05)`).
  - Buttons: background color toggles or inverts.
- **Shadows**
  - Subtle box-shadows on `.Post`, `.ProductCard`, and category labels.

---

## üß© Component Documentation

Below is an overview of key **reusable components** used in Remeskin. Each entry describes the component‚Äôs **purpose**, **props**, **styling**, **usage examples**, and **additional notes** on testing or edge cases.

---

### 1. `NavBar` (src/components/NavBar.js)

**Purpose**  
- Displays a responsive navigation bar at the top of the application.
- Shows different links and icons depending on whether the user is logged in (`currentUser` state) or logged out.

**Props**  
- *No direct props passed in*; instead, it relies on:
  - `useCurrentUser()` to check authentication status and display user-specific links.
  - `useSetCurrentUser()` to handle logouts.

**Styling**  
- Uses [React Bootstrap‚Äôs Navbar](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navbar/) under the hood.  
- Has **custom gradient** (`NavBar.module.css`), with hover effects that slightly darken the gradient.

**Usage Example**

```jsx
import NavBar from "./components/NavBar";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NavBar />
      {/* Other routes and components here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

**Edge Cases & Testing**:

- **Logged-out state**: Check that Sign In / Sign Up links appear, and that restricted links (like Add Post) are hidden.  
- **Logged-in state**: Ensure user-specific links (Profile, Sign Out) appear correctly. Test the sign-out flow (e.g., error handling if the logout fails).

### 2. `Avatar` (src/components/Avatar.js)

**Purpose**  
- Renders a circular user avatar (profile image) at a specified size.  
- Optional text can appear to the right of the avatar.

**Props**  
- `src` (**string**, required): The image URL for the avatar.  
- `height` (**number**, default=45): The avatar‚Äôs rendered size, used for both width and height.  
- `text` (**string | JSX**, optional): If provided, appears inline with the avatar image.

**Styling**  
- Controlled by `Avatar.module.css`, using:
  - `border-radius: 50%` for the circle.
  - `object-fit: cover` to ensure the image is neatly cropped.

```jsx

import Avatar from "./components/Avatar";

function ProfileBadge() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Avatar src="/images/profile.jpg" height={60} text="MyUserName" />
    </div>
  );
}

```

**Edge Cases & Testing:**

- **Broken image URL:** The default behavior is to show a broken image icon if `src` is invalid. Consider adding an `onError` fallback if desired.
- **Long text:** If text is lengthy, ensure it wraps or truncates correctly in small layouts.

### 3. `MoreDropdown` (src/components/MoreDropdown.js)

**Purpose**
- Renders a three-dot ‚Äúoptions‚Äù dropdown (using `<Dropdown>` from react-bootstrap).
- Typically used to display quick actions (e.g., **Edit / Delete**) on posts, comments, or profiles.

**Props**
- **`handleEdit`** *(function, optional)*: Called when the user selects **‚ÄúEdit‚Äù**.
- **`handleDelete`** *(function, optional)*: Called when the user selects **‚ÄúDelete‚Äù**.

**Styling**
- `.DropdownItem` classes in **MoreDropdown.module.css** minimize padding and customize alignment.
- By default, the dropdown is positioned to the left (`drop="left"`), which can be changed if needed.

**Usage Example**

```jsx

import { MoreDropdown } from "../components/MoreDropdown";

function PostActions({ onEdit, onDelete }) {
  return (
    <MoreDropdown handleEdit={onEdit} handleDelete={onDelete} />
  );
}

```

**Edge Cases & Testing**

- **No `handleEdit` or `handleDelete`**: The menu still appears, but selecting an action may do nothing.
- **Position conflicts**: In narrow layouts, `drop="left"` might cause the menu to extend off-screen. Verify on mobile.

### 4. `ProfileEditDropdown` (src/components/MoreDropdown.js)

**Purpose**
- A specialized variant of **MoreDropdown** for editing user profiles (**Edit Profile, Change Username, Change Password**).

**Props**
- **`id`** *(number, required)*: The profile ID used to build edit links.

**Styling & Usage**
- Similar to **MoreDropdown**, but includes unique menu items relevant to profile editing.

**Example Usage in `ProfilePage.js`**:

```jsx

{profile?.is_owner && <ProfileEditDropdown id={profile?.id} />}

```

**Edge Cases**

- Must ensure the logged-in user actually **‚Äúowns‚Äù** that profile.
- If the user navigates to these routes manually without permissions, handle server rejections (**401/403**).

### 5. `Asset` (src/components/Asset.js)

**Purpose**
- Shows either (or both) a **loading spinner** and an **image**, with optional text.
- Commonly used to display **loading states** or **no-results placeholders**.

**Props**
- **`spinner`** *(boolean, optional)*: If `true`, renders a `<Spinner animation="border" />`.
- **`src`** *(string, optional)*: A URL for a placeholder image.
- **`message`** *(string, optional)*: Text displayed below the spinner/image.

**Styling**
- **Asset.module.css** uses a **flex container** to center content.
- The spinner is from **react-bootstrap‚Äôs** `<Spinner>`.

**Usage Example**

```jsx

function LoadingExample() {
  return (
    <Asset spinner message="Fetching data..." />
  );
}

function NotFoundExample() {
  return (
    <Asset src="/images/no_results.png" message="No results found." />
  );
}

```

**Edge Cases & Testing**

- **Both `spinner` and `src`**: The component shows both the spinner and the image. Confirm layout is okay.
- **No props**: Renders an empty container if neither `spinner` nor `src` are provided.

### 6. `NotFound` (src/components/NotFound.js)

**Purpose**

- A simple **fallback component** indicating that a page or resource **does not exist** (**404-like message**).
- Often rendered when a **Route isn‚Äôt matched** or a **resource is missing**.

**Props**

- **None**

**Styling**

- Uses **NotFound.module.css**, which centers the message and an optional image.
- Internally imports the **Asset** component with a default message like:
  > *"Sorry, the page you're looking for doesn't exist."*

**Usage Example**

```jsx

import NotFound from "../components/NotFound";

function SomeRoutingComponent() {
  // ...
  <Route render={() => <NotFound />} />
}

```

**Edge Cases & Testing**

- **Conditional**: You could also show `<NotFound />` if a specific resource (**post, user, etc.**) wasn‚Äôt found by the API.
- **Custom messages**: If you want dynamic content, pass a prop or use your own logic. Currently, it's static.

### 7. `Form Components` (e.g., SignInForm, SignUpForm)

While these forms are more **feature-specific** than truly **reusable**, you may still want to document them briefly if multiple parts of the application share these patterns.

**Purpose**

- Each form handles a **unique user flow** (**sign in, sign up, etc.**).
- They often integrate **SweetAlert2** for **success/error feedback**.

**Notable Details**

- Usually rely on **axios.post()** calls (e.g., `POST /dj-rest-auth/login/`) and **context state updates** (`useSetCurrentUser`).
- Use **react-bootstrap** components:
  - `<Form>` for structured input fields.
  - `<Alert>` for validation/error messages.
  - `<Button>` for submission.

**Usage**

- Typically used as **pages**:

  ```jsx
  <Route path="/signup" element={<SignUpForm />} />

  ```

### `Final Thoughts on Components`

These component descriptions reflect the primary reusable elements of Remeskin. My goal is to provide clear guidance on their usage, styling, and potential edge cases so that future contributors or reviewers can quickly understand how each part of the UI is constructed. 

As the application grows, here are a few important points to keep in mind:

1. **Maintain Accuracy** ‚Äì Whenever new props are introduced or existing ones change, updating this documentation helps prevent confusion among collaborators.  
2. **Visual Demonstrations** ‚Äì Tools such as [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) can illustrate component variations and states in a more visual, interactive manner.  
3. **Testing** ‚Äì Adding both unit and integration tests ensures that each component behaves as intended and reduces the risk of regressions when making updates or adding new features.

By following these guidelines, I aim to keep the codebase well-structured and user-friendly for anyone who may work on or evaluate this project in the future.

#### üß™ Automated Testing

This project uses **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for automated testing. We have implemented the following test suites to ensure that key components work as expected:

- **NavBar.test.js**  
  *Tests the navigation bar component.*  
  - Verifies that when the user is logged out, the **Sign In** and **Sign Up** links are displayed and the **Sign Out** link is hidden.  
  - Checks that when a user is logged in, the **Profile** and **Sign Out** links are shown, while **Sign In** and **Sign Up** are hidden.
  
- **Post.test.js**  
  *Tests the Post component.*  
  - Ensures that post details (title, content, category) are rendered correctly.  
  - Simulates a non-owner user liking the post and verifies that the like action triggers an API call and updates the state.  
  - Checks that if the logged-in user is the owner of the post, the like action is disabled (a tooltip with the message "You can't like your own post!" is shown).

- **NotFound.test.js**  
  *Tests the NotFound component.*  
  - Confirms that the component renders a fallback message (e.g., "Sorry, the page you're looking for doesn't exist") and displays an image.

- **Avatar.test.js**  
  *Tests the Avatar component.*  
  - Validates that the avatar image is rendered with the correct source (`src`), height, and that accompanying text is displayed if provided.

### Running Automated Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash

## üöÄ Frontend Deployment

### Hosting Platform
- The frontend of the **Remeskin** platform is hosted on **Heroku**.

### Deployment Process
To deploy the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a production-ready build using:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - This command generates an optimized build in the `build/` folder.

2. **Create a Heroku App**:
   - Log in to Heroku using:
     ```bash
     heroku login
     ```
   - Create a new Heroku application:
     ```bash
     heroku create remeskin-frontend
     ```

3. **Configure Heroku for Static File Hosting**:
   - Add a `static.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "root": "build/"
     }
     ```
   - This tells Heroku to serve static files from the `build/` folder.

4. **Add Buildpacks**:
   - Configure Heroku buildpacks for React apps:
     ```bash
     heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app
     ```

5. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   - Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Add all files and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Deploy frontend to Heroku"
     ```
   - Push the code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```

6. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the environment variable for the backend API URL:
     ```bash
     heroku config:set REACT_APP_API_URL=<your-backend-api-url>
     ```

7. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Visit the live frontend application at the URL provided by Heroku.

### Environment Variables
- **REACT_APP_API_URL**: URL for the backend API (e.g., `https://drestf-api-8914bba56128.herokuapp.com/`).

### Continuous Deployment
- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for automatic deployment whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
  - Set up the deployment pipeline in the **Heroku Dashboard** under the "Deploy" tab.
