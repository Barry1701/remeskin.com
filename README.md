## üé® Design

This document outlines the key visual and UX design decisions for **Remeskin**, including color palette, typography, layout structure, and commonly used UI components.

---

### 1. Color Palette

In the CSS files, several repeated color patterns and gradients are used. Below is a consolidated palette:

- **Gradient (Navbar)**  
  - `#6dd5ed` ‚Üí `#2193b0` (linear gradient)
- **Gradient (Category Labels / ‚ÄúWow Effect‚Äù)**  
  - `#ff7e5f` ‚Üí `#feb47b`
- **Accent Colors**  
  - **Buttons & Background Variation**: `#242a3d` (dark blue-gray) or `#2142b2` (deep blue)  
  - **Hearts (Liked Posts)**: `#f85032`
- **Base Background** (in `index.css`)  
  - A repeated texture plus a light linear gradient (`#e6e9f0` ‚Üí `#eef1f5`)
- **Text**  
  - Default: `#333`  
  - Lighter text (e.g., dates): `#c1c1c5` or `#555555`

> **Tip:** If you want to standardize these colors further, consider defining them as CSS variables or SCSS variables.

---

### 2. Typography

- **Primary Font**: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) (imported in `index.html`).  
  - Fallback stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif`
- **Code Snippets**  
  - `source-code-pro, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace`
- **Font Sizes**  
  - Forms, buttons, and general text: typically `14px‚Äì16px`  
  - `.Header` class: `16px`, uppercase, letter-spacing  
  - Icons: `i { font-size: 1.6rem }`

Since Bootstrap 4.6 is included, I also inherit its default font sizing (e.g., `<h1>` through `<h6>`).

---

### 3. Icons

- **Font Awesome** is used via a `<script>` in `index.html`.
- Common icons:  
  - Sign-in/out (`fa-sign-in-alt`, `fa-sign-out-alt`), user (`fa-user`, `fa-user-plus`), heart (`fa-heart`), comments (`fa-comments`), etc.
- Additional usage:  
  - **3-dot menu**: `fa-ellipsis-v` (for `<MoreDropdown>`).

---

### 4. Layout & Responsiveness

#### 4.1 Overall Structure

- **Navbar** (fixed, gradient background)  
  - Uses `<Navbar>` from `react-bootstrap` and custom CSS in `NavBar.module.css`.
  - Collapses on mobile, toggled with a custom hook (`useClickOutsideToggle.js`).
- **Main Content**  
  - Wrapped in a `<Container>` with `.Main { padding-top: 81px }` to account for navbar height.
- **Background**  
  - A repeated dark texture plus a linear gradient, set in `body` (see `index.css`).

#### 4.2 CSS Modules & Media Queries

- Each component (e.g., `NavBar`, `Post`, `Comment`) often has its own `.module.css`.
- **Responsive breakpoints** leverage Bootstrap‚Äôs defaults (sm, md, lg, xl).
  - For instance, `.d-none d-lg-block` to hide/show elements depending on screen size.

#### 4.3 Common Layout Patterns

- **Two-column layout** on wider screens: main feed (`lg=8`) + sidebar (`lg=4`).
- On smaller viewports, the sidebar is hidden or moved below the main feed.

---

### 5. Core UI Components

1. **Navbar** (`NavBar.js`)
   - Gradient background, sign-in / sign-up links for guests, or user profile links if logged in.
   - `.NavLink` classes control text color, hover transitions, and icons.

2. **Buttons** (various styles in `Button.module.css`)
   - Classes like `.Blue`, `.BlueOutline`, `.Black`, `.BlackOutline`, `.Bright`.
   - Rounded corners (`border-radius: 100px`), hover states that invert colors, etc.

3. **Cards / Posts**
   - Implemented via `<Card>` from `react-bootstrap` + additional styles in `Post.module.css`.
   - Category labels (like ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúEczema‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllergy‚Äù) have bright gradient backgrounds with hover scaling.

4. **Forms** (Sign in/up, PostCreateForm, ProductCreateForm, etc.)
   - Typically use `<Form>` from `react-bootstrap` plus modular CSS (`SignInUpForm.module.css`, `PostCreateEditForm.module.css`).
   - Validation errors displayed with `<Alert>`.

5. **Alerts / Modals**
   - [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for success/error confirmations.
   - `<Alert>` from `react-bootstrap` for inline messages (e.g., form validation).

6. **Avatars**
   - `Avatar.js` uses `.Avatar` from `Avatar.module.css` to present user images in circular form.

---

### 6. Highlights & Visual Effects

- **Hover States**
  - Navbar: slightly darker gradient on hover.
  - Category chips: color gradient flips, scale effect (`transform: scale(1.05)`).
  - Buttons: background color toggles or inverts.
- **Shadows**
  - Subtle box-shadows on `.Post`, `.ProductCard`, and category labels.

---

## üöÄ Frontend Deployment

### Hosting Platform
- The frontend of the **Remeskin** platform is hosted on **Heroku**.

### Deployment Process
To deploy the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a production-ready build using:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - This command generates an optimized build in the `build/` folder.

2. **Create a Heroku App**:
   - Log in to Heroku using:
     ```bash
     heroku login
     ```
   - Create a new Heroku application:
     ```bash
     heroku create remeskin-frontend
     ```

3. **Configure Heroku for Static File Hosting**:
   - Add a `static.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "root": "build/"
     }
     ```
   - This tells Heroku to serve static files from the `build/` folder.

4. **Add Buildpacks**:
   - Configure Heroku buildpacks for React apps:
     ```bash
     heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app
     ```

5. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   - Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Add all files and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Deploy frontend to Heroku"
     ```
   - Push the code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```

6. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the environment variable for the backend API URL:
     ```bash
     heroku config:set REACT_APP_API_URL=<your-backend-api-url>
     ```

7. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Visit the live frontend application at the URL provided by Heroku.

### Environment Variables
- **REACT_APP_API_URL**: URL for the backend API (e.g., `https://drestf-api-8914bba56128.herokuapp.com/`).

### Continuous Deployment
